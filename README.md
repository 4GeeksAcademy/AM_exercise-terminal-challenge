This command line challenge is designed to help you become familiar with the terminal. This challenge goes over the most used commands every developer needs to know in order to succeed in life.

> ‚ùó We recommend reading the lesson [The Command Line](https://4geeks.com/lesson/the-command-line-the-terminal) on the 4Geeks.com platform before doing this exercise.

üíª The challenge is designed for computers using Linux bash. Use GitHub Codespaces or Gitpod if you need a cloud terminal.

## üå± How to start this project

### üë©‚Äçüéì Students and Teachers must follow this step

This project comes with the necessary files to start working immediately.

We recommend opening this very same repository using a development environment like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). 

This is the repository you need to open:

```text
https://github.com/breatheco-de/excercise-terminal-challenge.git
```

**üëâ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer.

On **Windows and some Linux configurations**, there is a character limit on file or folder names. In this case, it seems the repository has an extremely long directory name, preventing Git from cloning it correctly.

Follow these steps:
```
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-terminal-challenge.git
cd exercise-terminal-challenge
git checkout HEAD -- 
``` 

> üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## Only teachers must follow this step:

#### 1) Install the packages.

```bash
$ npm install
```

#### 2) Run the presentation.

```bash
$ npm run start
```
