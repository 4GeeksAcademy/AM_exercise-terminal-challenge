This command line challenge is designed to help you become familiar with the bash/command line. The challenge goes over the most used commands every developer needs to know in order to succeed in real life.

> ‚ùó We strongly recommend reading [The Command Line lesson](https://4geeks.com/lesson/the-command-line-the-terminal) on the 4Geeks.com platform.

üíª The challenge is built for computers using the Linux bash. Use Codespaces or Gitpod if you are running on Windows (instructions below).

There are 2 ways to start:

a) Open this link in your browser with [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod): https://github.com/codespaces/new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/python-hello

b) You can clone this repository on your local computer:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-hello
```

### Steps

- If working locally, you should have python [installed](https://4geeks.com/how-to/how-to-install-python).

- You should open the terminal on the path of this template and run `$ python3 app.py`, if everything works correctly, it should show `Hello World` on the terminal.

- You can test your code by typing: `$ python3 test.py`.

üí° Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.
